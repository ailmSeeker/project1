### The API
http://api.alquran.cloud/v1/quran/en.asad

### Plan

This is my working plan for the implementation. I created a flashcard and than use that to test both the verse and audio check and 
have implemented a basic api that will call the quran. Now what I wish to do is to create an interface that will allow you to select
what you want to work on and than generate the flashcards based on that selection. 

So I think first we will create a user interface that will allow the person to choose which letter to work on. Than the user will go through
a series of flash cards and if they perform to a good level they will be successful and that level will be finished. u
